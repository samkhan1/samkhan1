### The Blue Pill

For those who would like to download this corpus (set of articles) to try their skills in extracting key insights form it. 

```
Prompt: 

Using a frequency analysis of the words in these writings, 
including this README.md file, 
look for greater than six lettered words, 
that have been used only once in the entire set of articles.
The location of that word, is where you will find a more valuable kernel of knowledge.
```

### The Red Pill

Venturing into this particular, "choose your own adventure style" mixed-media-art, might only be useful and exciting for those who are a king, at spelunking, within cave networks hidden under-the-sea. 

Or, if you think you can chase a rabbit down its rabbit hole like a python or an anaconda, then simply follow the rabbit. 

**Question:** [Why do wars happen?](https://github.com/my-realm/depth-first/blob/master/martial-influencers.pdf) 

**Answer:** Basically, when it becomes too inconvenient not to have a war, one tends to start. And also because many of the previous ones that had started a long time ago, never ended, they are simply ongoing, perpetual wars.
