### The Blue Pill

For those who would like to download this corpus to try their skills in extracting key insights form it. 

```
Hint: 

Using a frequency analysis of the words in these writings, 
including this README.md file, 
look for greater than six lettered words, 
that have been used only once in the entire set of articles.
The location of that word, is where you will find a more valuable kernel of knowledge.

Or, if you think you can chase a rabbit down its rabbit hole like a python or an anaconda, then simply follow the rabbit.
